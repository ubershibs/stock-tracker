# Stock Tracker
This app is still in development. I am building it as part of Free Code Camp's Back End Web Development Certification process.
### User Stories
- I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
  - Status: Done - still tweaking chart options   
- I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
  - Status: Done.
- I can remove stocks.
  - Status: Done - this was annoying to get working, for some reason.
- I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
  - Status: Done. Need to do some more rigorous testing, though.

### Built Using
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
